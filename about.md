Jekyll uses the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and Ruby to generate blog sites.  GitHub Pages is very compatible with Jekyll and has it as its primary engine - using Ruby in the background to generate HTML based on the markdown entered.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
