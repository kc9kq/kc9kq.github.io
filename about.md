The main page says enough about HVARC...

Site maintained by Scott Onson KD9GBJ.  To contribute, you must be a write-access member of [the HVARC organization](https://github.com/kc9kq) on GitHub.

Website built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Jekyll uses the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and Ruby to generate blog sites.  GitHub Pages is very compatible with Jekyll and has it as its primary engine - using Ruby in the background to generate HTML based on the markdown entered.

See this [introductory post about the engine](/jekyll/update/2021/11/18/welcome-to-jekyll.html) for instructions on how to add a post.  This must be done via Forking the repo to your personal domain, then submitting a pull request.
