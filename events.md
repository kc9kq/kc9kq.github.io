## Field Day

This event is held annually on the last Saturday of June.  This is an annual event organized by the American Amateur Radio League. It consists of various activities conducted by hams including a CQ party, demonstrations for the public, media reach-outs and emergency outreach.

HVARC participates in Field Day regularly. The event location is decided in the meetings prior to the event. Equipment is supplied by operators and the club owns a trailer in which operations take place. The club uses its call sign (KC9KQ) for the new and inexperienced to participate in advanced contacts (those reserved for the general and amateur extra licensees)

## Wisconsin QSO Party
West Allis Radio Amateur Club hosts this event annually on the second weekend of March.  HVARC members participate in the party every year.  More information is available on [WARAC's site](https://www.warac.org/wqp/wqp.htm)
