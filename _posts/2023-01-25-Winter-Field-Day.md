We are sorry to announce that we have chosen to cancel our Winter Field Day in Prairie du Chien WI.

Due to low temperatures and forecasted snow, it doesn't look like it will be a pleasant event. Instead, we suggest our members visit the Platteville Public Library for the club's participation in the Community Fair.

We feel that Field Day is primarily a public awareness event for us and the conditions wouldn't help that goal.

Thank you for understanding and we'll see you in Platteville!
