Welcome to the home of Hidden Valleys Amateur Radio Club (HVARC). We are a small friendly club located in the hills and valleys of Southwestern Wisconsin. Our members participate in Field Day, Wisconsin QSO parties, local community service activities, and also offer ham licensing classes. Many of us are trained storm spotters, some have CPR, and a few have multiple Red Cross certifications.

All amateurs and those interested in amateur radio are welcome at club meetings and events.
